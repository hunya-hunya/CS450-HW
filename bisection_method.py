# Implement the bisection method on the provided function f. 
# Stop when your last two x values differ by less than 10^-13.
# Print your x values at each iteration.

# INPUT:
# f, a function for which you should find a root
# x0 and x1, two starting values

# OUTPUT:
# zero, your approximation to the zero of the function
# A plot of f with your zero marked (already produced by the provided plotting code)
